# The Akecian Language Guide

## This page is currently under construction!

This is an introduction to the Akecian language. If you know several different languages, it should be easier to catch on to what you will learn in this one. While it is not necessary, having a background with Slavic and Baltic languages will help you understand the core fundamentals. Consider also that the old version of the Akecian language was based primarily on Czech and Slovak.

## The Roots System

The new version of the Akecian language introduces a new system of roots. Words are constructed using different roots to come up with a general idea. For newcomers, this system may be confusing, so examples will be provided below to enhance your learning experience.

Let's break down this idea even further:

- Words start with a root. Think of it as like a short word that describes a basic term.
- Affixes are added to roots to describe more precise ideas.

  - Prefixes add more meaning to a word. They change the meaning of the root.

  - Suffixes are usually preserved for adding past or future tenses, as well as associating a verb with a person.

  - Suffixes also describe the grammatical case of a word, rather than the English word order system.

- Multiple affixes can be placed on words to consturct a more precise meaning.

Unlike with previous versions, past and future tenses and now part of verbs. They are usually added to the end of the root word. This allows more concise traveling of information.
