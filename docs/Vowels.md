## Vowels
There are many vowels included in the Aclevian language. To help make it easier to understand, we separate them into versions of vowels.

- a - Short Vowel 
  - pronounced **A**pple
- á - long vowel
  - Pronounced like the example above, but a longer sound. 
  - You essentially pronounce the sound for a longer interval.
- ä - pronounced vowels
  - Pronounced like above, but heavier.
  - For instance: ah, eh, ih, oh, uh...
- ą - nasal vowel
  - With nasal vowels, you are making the sounds with your nose instead of your mouth.
  - This means your mouth should be closed and you should feel air coming out of your nose while making these sounds.
- ǎ - diphthong
  - We call these long vowels in English.
  - For example, the word h**ei**ght uses this diphthong.

(Keep in mind these are examples. Letters a, e, i, o, u, and y use the same diacritics for their version of each vowel.)

If you know West Slavic languages such as Czech, Slovak, or Polish, these might be familiar to you. That's because we use the same system those languages use to classify ours. They are also pronounced the same, so feel free to pronounce them as you would in those languages.

Here is a table with every vowel with an example:
